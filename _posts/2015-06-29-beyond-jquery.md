title: ...and Much, Much More!
---

You asked for more, and I was happy to oblige, because this blog only scratches the surface. On [Twitter][twitter], and in the discussion sections here, I mentioned that a longer-form version of my YDNjQ series was in progress. A few months again, I began writing [a new book titled "Beyond jQuery"][beyond-jquery]. My book aims to greatly expand on the topics I have written about in this blog. There will be _much_ more detail, _much_ more code, and I will cover _many_ more topics. Expect the book to be about 15 chapters and 300 pages.

Today, I am finally able to make [the first four chapters of my book][beyond-jquery] available to you! Carrying on the tradition of this blog, Beyond jQuery will follow a [lean publishing process][lean-publishing]. In short, I will be publishing new chapters as I complete them and will take reader feedback into account when considering adjustments to existing chapters as well as planned chapters.

Once you've purchased a copy of the book-in-progress, you will have access to all future updates, including new chapters as they are published. So, go get a copy of Beyond jQuery now while it's still in progress and (and discounted as a result)! As a subscriber and you will have the ability to influence the book _as it is being written_!
